> Notes by Ling Kangjie

- Object Detection (OD) has received significant attention in recent years from ICCV and CVPR.
- OD is the basis of high level vision tasks such as segmentation, scene understanding, object tracking, image captioning, event detection, and activity recognition.
- OD can be grouped into two types: detection of specific instances versus the detection of board categories.
